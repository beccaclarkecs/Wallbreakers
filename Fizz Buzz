#Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.
#But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and 
#for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.#
#Example: n = 15, Return: [ "1", "2","Fizz", "4", "Buzz","Fizz","7", "8", "Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"
